Aggregated Feedback for the Classification Projects:
Clarifying the Purpose of Documents in the Project:

Readme – gives an abstract or summary of your notebook, it should include findings, a data dictionary, and a brief overview of your process. This should entice the reader to want to read your notebook to get the full analysis.

Notebook – justify your conclusions by showing the process you followed to obtain the results that you did. Be explicit about why you chose the features you did, how you created your baseline, what your modeling process is and clearly identify your Test model
 (Repeatability is key)

Data Dictionary – Remove ambiguity in your feature names. Not Provide dictionary definitions for terms in your analysis. What I mean by not provide dictionary definitions is that a data dictionary is not about capturing the "true" meaning of the words in each featured title but showing how those words should be interpreted in the context of the analysis. For example, the word partner in google can mean either of a "pair of people engaged together in the same activity" among its other definitions. In the case of the Telco data partner likely means a romantic partner, in other data sets partner, could mean a business or tag-team partner. A good data dictionary goes beyond dictionary definitions and clears away any ambiguity in how the author of the notebook interprets the features he or she is using in the analysis
It is okay to assume that the reader of the notebook knows the definition of data science terms (or at least has access to google search). Data dictionaries are there to clear up ambiguities that can’t be solved by Google search.
Other feedback:

Always mention outliers and what you did or didn’t do with them.

Try to pair your takeaways with the individual chart or test it came from. Don’t show a bunch of charts and then list the takeaways from all of them. It makes seeing where your observations come from difficult to follow.

Try to title your chart with the takeaway you want the reader to get from the chart.
Don’t just add rubric items for the sake of checking a box (charts and hypotheses testing). Read incorporate this item into your analysis in a meaningful way.
